## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

# Intro to R for Biologists

This is a basic intro to R and the Tidyverse for biologists. The link for this brief course is here: [Intro R for Biologists](https://melbournebioinformatics.github.io/r-intro-biologists/intro_r_biologists.html)

It uses the following RNA seq data

## **RNA-seq dataset**

Here we will create some plots using RNA-seq data from the paper by [Fu et al.Â 2015](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25730472), GEO code GSE60450. This study examined expression in basal and luminal cells from mice at different stages (virgin, pregnant and lactating). There are 2 samples per group and 6 groups, 12 samples in total.

This is the same data used in the Galaxy RNA seq tutorial (also written by Maria Doyle - and others)
